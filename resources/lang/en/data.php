    halls as well as an exquisite restaurant and comfortable suites. The rooms of
    our hotel will be a pleasant surprise even for the most demanding customers.
    The interior design of the complex is special for its sense of taste and creativity.
    At “<strong>Tsghotner</strong>” highly professional specialists will provide you with unique massage
    and spa services. When we say “<strong>sauna</strong>” we often imagine a hot, stuffy room, where
